Targetable as Construct
	CATEGORY:Special Ability
	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary.Weakness.VulnerabilityEnergy
	DESC:As living constructs, warforged can be affected by spells that target living creatures as well as by those that target constructs. Damage dealt to a warforged can be healed by a cure light wounds spell or a repair light damage spell, for example, and a warforged is vulnerable to disable construct and harm. However, spells from the healing subschool and supernatural abilities that cure hit point damage or ability damage provide only half their normal effect to a warforged.

Unsual Physical Construction
	CATEGORY:Special Ability
	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary.Weakness
	DESC:The unusual physical construction of warforged makes them vulnerable to certain spells and effects that normally don’t affect living creatures. A warforged takes damage from heat metal and chill metal as if he were wearing metal armor. Likewise, a warforged is affected by repel metal or stone as if he were wearing metal armor. A warforged is repelled by repel wood. The iron in the body of a warforged makes him vulnerable to rusting grasp. The creature takes 2d6 points of damage from the spell (Refl ex half;save DC 14 + caster’s ability modifi er). A warforged takes the same damage from a rust monster’s touch (Refl ex DC 17 half). Spells such as stone to flesh, stone shape, warp wood, and wood shape affect objects only, and thus cannot be used on the stone and wood parts of a warforged.
