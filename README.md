# Warforged for Pathfinder
This is a simple pcgen homebrew ruleset that implements most of the rules for the Warforged race into pathfinder. This is not a complete replication of the rules. I should also mention that I copied [admorgan's](https://github.com/admorgan/pcgen-eberron) implementation of composite/mithral plating.
